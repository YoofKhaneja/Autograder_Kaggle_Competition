# ELL_Essay_Grader_Ayush_Yash_Aryaman
Final project for data mining by Ayush, Aryaman and Yash.<br>

We aim to build an automated essay grading system for ELL students from 8th grade to 12th grade. The dataset used is a part of a Kaggle Competition: The Feedback Prize - English Language Learning. Existing essay grading methods consist of models trained on essays written by students with english as their first language. As a result they are not able to aptly grade essays written by ELL students (students having English as their second language). This project aims to solve this problem by building a system that can successfully assess the writing of such ELL students.
